<p>Building codes and regulations evolve over time to enhance safety and structural integrity standards. An outdated roof may not meet current building codes, leaving your home vulnerable to regulatory issues and potential fines. By replacing your roof with materials that meet or exceed current standards, you ensure compliance with regulations and avoid legal complications.</p>
